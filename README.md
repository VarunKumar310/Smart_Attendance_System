# Smart Attendance System 🎓🧠

## 🔍 Project Overview

The **Smart Attendance System** is a facial recognition-based web application developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Flask**. It utilizes **Artificial Intelligence** to scan and verify student faces for automated attendance. The system ensures that only registered students can mark their attendance and stores the attendance records in a **CSV file** for easy tracking and reporting.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **AI-Powered Facial Recognition** for accurate and contactless attendance marking.
- 🧑‍🎓 **Student Registration**: New students can register their facial data through the system.
- 📷 **Take Attendance**: Registered students can mark their attendance by scanning their face.
- 📄 **CSV Attendance Logs**: Attendance data is saved in a structured CSV file for easy access.
- 🌐 **Clean Frontend**: User-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- 🛠️ **Flask Backend**: Handles logic, file management, and facial recognition.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)  
- **AI/ML**: Face Recognition using OpenCV or Dlib  
- **Data Storage**: CSV File for storing attendance logs.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. 📝 **Register**: New students register by capturing their facial data, which is stored for future recognition.
2. 📸 **Take Attendance**: Registered students scan their face using the camera. If the face matches, attendance is marked.
3. 📂 **Log Data**: Attendance entries are saved in a `.csv` file with the student’s name, date, and time.
